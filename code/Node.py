class Node:
    """
    A class used to represent a Miner node in a BlockChain network. Initialized with node ID string. This class
    sets up a thread that continually mines new blocks from a transaction queue, meeting a predefined hash
    difficulty. Node uses Messenger (SQS) to send and receive messages from other nodes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    difficulty : int
        indicates hash difficulty for mining blocks, integer represents number of leading 0s required
    hash_difficulty : str
        reference for hash difficulty as represented by a 64 char hexadecimal hash
    node_id : str
        name of node (in this case '0', '1', '2', or '3'
    ledger : Ledger
        ledger associated with the blockchain for checking validity of transactions and peer balances
    blockchain : BlockChain
        this is the node's copy of the blockchain for reference and updating
    messenger : Messenger
        a messaging layer used by the node to send and receive blocks and transactions from other miners
    peers : list
        a list of peer nodes, members of the BlockChain network
    transaction_queue : list
        a list of incoming transactions to be mined into a block
    reset_mine_function : bool
        flag for when a new block is discovered, when true node resets flag and begins mining on new block instead
    stop_mine_function : bool
        flag for stopping the mining thread
    mine_thread : thread
        a stored reference to the mining thread for accessing the thread if necessary

    Methods
    -------
    start_mining_thread()
        Starts the thread that continually mines new blocks to add to the chain.
    handle_incoming_message()
        interface required for the Messenger class, handles incoming messages from the Messenger class.
    mining_thread()
        continually mines new blocks on current blockchain, resets function when new block received
    hash_block()
        the actual function that generates a hash for a new block to add to the blockchain
    send_block(block: str)
        sends newly mined blocks to all peers
